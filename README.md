# ionic2-login
Ionic 2 application login with basic auth


Basic authentication uses base64 to encrypt username and password before sending it to restAPI.

After user log in for the first time after that it uses token from the first request as authentication.

You can run the project using Ionic CLI while in project directory entering comand: 

ionic serve 

or 

ionic serve --lab 

for cross-platform support.

Just open node.js command prompt and navigate to project folder using cd commands.
